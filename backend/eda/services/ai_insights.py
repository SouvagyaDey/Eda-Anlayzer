- **Unit Errors**: Cm entered as m, thousands entered as millions, etc.
- **Typos**: Extra zeros, decimal point errors (100.0 entered as 1000)
- **Copy-Paste Errors**: Values from wrong row/column
- **Recommendation**: Flag for review and correction

**Measurement Errors**:

**Option 4: Keep**:
- Which outliers are legitimate and should remain?
- Use robust statistics (median, IQR) instead of mean/std dev

## 7. Advanced Feature Engineering Recommendations (500-600 words)

### 7.1 Numeric Variable Transformations

**Scaling & Normalization**:
For EACH numeric variable, specify:
- **Standardization (Z-score)**: (X - mean) / std_dev
  - List variables that need standardization
  - Why: For algorithms sensitive to scale (SVM, KNN, Neural Networks, PCA)
  - When features have different units or magnitudes
- **Min-Max Scaling**: (X - min) / (max - min) ‚Üí [0,1]
  - List variables suitable for min-max scaling
  - Why: When you need bounded range [0,1]
  - When distribution is not Gaussian
- **Robust Scaling**: Using median and IQR instead of mean/std
  - List variables with outliers that need robust scaling
  - Why: Less sensitive to outliers
  - Good alternative when outliers are legitimate

**Mathematical Transformations**:
- **Log Transform**: log(X + 1) or log(X)
  - List variables needing log transformation
  - Why: Reduce right skew, handle exponential relationships
  - When: Data spans multiple orders of magnitude (prices, counts, income)
  - Note: Add 1 if zeros exist
- **Square Root Transform**: ‚àöX
  - List variables for square root transformation
  - Why: Moderate right skew, count data
  - When: Poisson-distributed data
- **Box-Cox Transform**: Optimal power transformation
  - Variables with severe non-normality
  - Find optimal Œª parameter
- **Reciprocal Transform**: 1/X
  - For specific relationships (time ‚Üí rate)

  - Create polynomial features for non-linear relationships
  - List candidate variables for polynomial expansion

**Binning & Discretization**:
For continuous variables that should become categorical:

- **Equal-Frequency Binning**: Same number of observations per bin
  - Variables with skewed distributions
  - Ensures balanced bins
- **Custom Binning**: Business-driven thresholds

  - Decision tree-based binning

### 7.2 Categorical Variable Encoding

Specify encoding strategy for EACH categorical variable:

**One-Hot Encoding (Dummy Variables)**:

- Creates N-1 binary columns
- Example: Color (Red, Blue, Green) ‚Üí Color_Red, Color_Blue
- Warning: Avoid with high cardinality (dimension explosion)

**Label Encoding (Ordinal Encoding)**:
- List ordinal variables with natural order
- Example: Education (High School=1, Bachelor=2, Master=3, PhD=4)
- Warning: Don't use for nominal variables (implies order)

**Frequency Encoding**:
- List high-cardinality variables
- Replace category with its frequency/count
- Preserves information about category popularity

**Target Encoding (Mean Encoding)**:
- Replace category with mean target value for that category
- Use with cross-validation to avoid leakage
- Good for high-cardinality variables in supervised learning

**Binary Encoding**:
- For medium cardinality (10-100 categories)
- Converts to binary digits
- More compact than one-hot

**Embedding**:
- For very high cardinality (100+ categories)
- Learn dense representations
- Use in neural networks

**Group Rare Categories**:
- List categories with < 5% frequency
- Combine into "Other" category
- Reduces dimensionality and overfitting

### 7.4 Feature Selection Strategy

After engineering features, recommend:
- **Filter Methods**: Correlation threshold, Variance threshold, Chi-square test
- **Wrapper Methods**: Forward selection, Backward elimination, RFE
- **Embedded Methods**: L1 regularization (Lasso), Tree feature importance
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP for high-dimensional data
